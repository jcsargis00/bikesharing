# NYC Citibike Bikesharing Study
#
## Analysis
#
Data from the Citibike bikesharing company has been analyzed and put together with Tableau Visualization software.
To get started, tripduration data was converted from an integer to a datetime in seconds.  The new format was saved
into a csv file to be used for the visualization examples.
### Overview of the statistical analysis
#
Checkout times for all riders are shown below:

#
To determine if bikesharing is preferred by one gender over another, checkout times by gender with length of time bike is used is displayed below:

#
Do more bike trips take place by weekday at certain hours?  A graph the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap is below to show the data.

Finally, a heatmap that shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each Usertype (customer or subscriber)
